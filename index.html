                            If you’d asked a panel of experts 10 years ago what smartphones would look like in a decade,<br>
                            you’d have gotten all kinds of wild responses. Recall that in 2001 the biggest thing in cell phone technology was the Nokia 8250,<br>
                            the chief selling point of which was its colorful display. Instead of black-and-white, this phone’s screen was blue. At the time,<br>
                            this was huge. Looking back, it’s startling that we went from that to the iPhone in just six years. Given an evolutionary leap of that magnitude,<br>
                            who could say then what would happen given another 10? Will smartphones, as we know them, even exist?<br>

                            we polled a panel of experts on what the smartphone might look like another 10 years from now,<br>
                            and they were optimistic that things would change substantially.
                            How substantially? Read below to find out.<br>

                            By and large the phone as we know it is an artifact dictated by the technology of the early-to-mid 2000s.<br>
                            We don’t want the black boxes in our bags and pockets. We want access, communication, and connection.<br>
                            As the technology advances, so does the form and capacity of our devices.<br>

                            The future of the smartphone—or connection device(s)—will likely rely on more deeply engaging us sensorially as humans.<br>
                            As virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) becomes a truer, more holistic extended reality (XR), then the capacity for overlaying,<br>
                            and enlarging our actual reality and social networks with sight, sound, tactile, etc. experiences is vast. Flexible materials,<br>
                            scalable displays, retinal and holographic projection, smartwatches and glasses, and bionic implants already exist.<br>
                            In 10 years they will have been refined and expanded in the same way the phone has been over the past decade.<br>
                            Likely faster. When you overlay advances in facial (human) recognition, wireless connections,<br>
                            and quantum computing, means of connection can be embedded everywhere.<br>
                            We reach a point where we may no longer need to carry devices at all.<br>

                            Sounds cool, right? I would be remiss if I didn’t also point to the fact that,<br>
                            like many people, I struggle with what I perceive as a substantial smartphone addiction.<br>
                            It is the first and last thing I touch every day. I wonder if there will come a point when<br>
                            we humans decide that we can subsist, even thrive, without being so constantly connected, <br>
                            tracked, quantified, stimulated, informed, and engaged. When it comes to dopamine,<br>
                            humans are not the best at making decisions in our and our planet’s best interests.<br>

                            My job is basically to draw up concepts for how we might use our phones and devices 2-5 years from now.<br>
                            In ten years, it’s an open question whether the smartphone will still be the one device to rule them all.<br>

                            Some time ago, 
                            we migrated to the mobile phone from a world where the desktop computer was the focus of all our computing.<br>
                            In many ways, the mobile phone almost replaced or supplanted the desktop computer—it didn’t necessarily augment it.<br> 
                            Those two things, desktop and mobile, still operate in parallel and duplicative ways. You might perform the same task on both devices,<br> 
                            but fundamentally you’re operating in parallel worlds.<br>

                            Yet from the very beginning of the foundational era for personal computing,<br>
                            people have had a different vision—a vision for a world in which you’re surrounded by a universe of objects.<br> 
                            These objects are not necessarily general computing devices; they might just be the thing that’s closest at hand and most natural<br> 
                            to use at that moment but still offer you everything you need. This would be a world of thin clients—basically,<br> 
                            interface devices that don’t necessarily have all the computing power within them,<br> 
                            but that use the cloud to deliver the apps and services you need.<br>

                            the smartphone continues to be a central hub for all our services,<br>
                            containing everything you care about. This phone is tethered to a bunch of devices—your car,<br> 
                            your earbuds, etc. Down the other, the phone is just another thin client, another interface paradigm.<br>
                            It may still be the most dominant, or at least the most ubiquitous,<br> 
                            but your identity will be abstracted away from the actual phone.<br>

                            An obvious example of what this might look like would be the movie Her: you see a kind of where the OS is a continuous,<br>
                            responsive presence, which he accesses by picking up whatever device is close at hand as he moves through the world. The OS doesn’t<br>
                             exist in any one of these things—it exists in all of them, drawing from some central, non-local repository. This is a pretty good<br>
                             illustration of the vision of ubiquitous computing that has been around for 40 years.<br>
